# Sourced by scripts/apply-update.sh AFTER the new files are in place, so a change here (a new step, a new image to refresh) takes effect
# in the very update that delivers it. The update script itself is the copy already on the host and only changes on the next update.
# Not run on its own: it uses the update script's COMPOSE, STATE_HELPER, phase and log, and sets DEPLOY_STAGE for its rollback decision.
